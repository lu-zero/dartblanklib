# dartblanklib
## A starting spot for a dart library.

### Why?
> As I was building [dartlib](https://github.com/kevmoo/dartlib) I realized there were few other examples of dart libraries. I was making up conventions (directory names, etc) as I went along based on my experience with *Ruby/Gems* and *node.js* among others.

### How to

If you want to **build a new library**, I'd suggest [downloading](https://github.com/kevmoo/dartblanklib/downloads) the contents of the project and putting them in a new directory. From there you can do `git init` and start from scratch.

If you want to **contribute** tweaks, fixes, or documentation to `dartblanklib` then clone the [repository](https://github.com/kevmoo/dartblanklib).

### Structure

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>readme.md</td>
    <td>
      <p>All projects should have one. You should delete the contents out of this one and start from scratch.</p>
      <p>The `md` extension means <a href='http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/'>Markdown</a> which github parses nicely.</p>
      <p><em>Although &lt;table&gt; support is not ideal.</em></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>pubspec</td>
    <td>A place to put external dependencies. See the notes in the file.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>lib/</td>
    <td>See <code>readme.me</code> in the lib directory.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>test/</td>
    <td>See <code>readme.me</code> in the test directory.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>vendor/</td>
    <td>See <code>readme.me</code> in the vendor directory.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>samples/</td>
    <td>...todo...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><em>bin/</em></td>
    <td>...todo...</td>
  </tr>
</table>
